## What is a server?

A server is like a big, powerful computer that helps other computers do things they can't do alone. It's like a helpful friend that stores information, shows web pages, sends emails, and much more!
What is the role of the domain name?

The domain name is like a nickname for websites. Instead of remembering long strings of numbers (IP addresses), we use easy-to-remember names to visit websites. It's like having a name tag for your favorite websites!

## What type of DNS record is www in www.foobar.com?

The "www" in "www.foobar.com" is called a CNAME record. It's like a signpost that tells computers where to find the website when we type the domain name into our browser.

## What is the role of the web server?

The web server is like a super-fast waiter at a restaurant. It's in charge of bringing us the web pages we want to see when we go online. It stores and handles all the web pages and makes sure they show up correctly on our screens.

## What is the role of the application server?

The application server is like the brain behind a website. It's super smart and does all the hard work behind the scenes. It handles things like user input, calculations, and making sure everything on the website works smoothly.

## What is the role of the database?

The database is like a huge library where all the information for the website is stored. It keeps everything organized and makes sure the website knows what to show us when we ask for something. It stores things like user accounts, posts, and comments.

## What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website?

The server uses something called HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website. It's like a language that computers use to talk to each other on the internet. So, when we type a website address into our browser, the server understands our request and sends us the web pages we want to see!

## SPOF (Single Point of Failure):

Reliance on a single server means any failure in that server could bring down the entire website, resulting in significant downtime and potential loss of business.

## Downtime During Maintenance:

Performing maintenance tasks like deploying new code requires restarting the web server, causing downtime during which the website is inaccessible to users.

## Inability to Scale with High Traffic:

With only one server, the infrastructure struggles to handle sudden spikes in traffic, leading to slower performance or even crashes during periods of high demand.
